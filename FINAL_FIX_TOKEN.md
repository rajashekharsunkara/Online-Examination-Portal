# 🔧 FINAL FIX - Authentication Token Issue

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed

### Problem
**Proctoring API returning 404 errors:**
```
:5173/api/v1/proctoring/events:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
```

### Root Cause
All proctoring hooks were using **wrong token key**:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG (what hooks were using)
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');

// ✅ CORRECT (actual key in localStorage)
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
```

The API was rejecting requests due to missing/invalid authentication, returning 404/403 instead of processing the proctoring events.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `/web/src/hooks/useFullScreen.ts`
2. ✅ `/web/src/hooks/useVisibilityDetection.ts`
3. ✅ `/web/src/hooks/useKeyboardBlocking.ts`
4. ✅ `/web/src/hooks/useQuestionTiming.ts`

### Change Made:
```typescript
// Changed in all 4 files:
localStorage.getItem('token') → localStorage.getItem('access_token')
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

### Before (with wrong token):
```
❌ :5173/api/v1/proctoring/events:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
❌ :5173/api/v1/proctoring/events:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
```

### After (with correct token):
```
✅ Proctoring events logged successfully
✅ Full-screen violations recorded
✅ Tab switches logged
✅ Keyboard blocks logged
✅ Question timing synced
```

## 🧪 Test Now

### No need to restart containers!
Vite will hot-reload the changes automatically.

### Test Steps:
1. **Stay on exam page** (or refresh if needed)
2. **Press F12** - Should see: `🚫 Developer Tools blocked`
3. **Check console** - Should now see successful proctoring logs
4. **Try violations:**
   - Press ESC (full-screen exit)
   - Switch tabs
   - Try Ctrl+C
5. **Check console** - Events should be logged (no 404 errors!)

---

## 📊 Verification

### Check Database for Events:
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U exam_user -d exam_db -c "
  SELECT event_type, severity, COUNT(*) 
  FROM proctoring_events 
  WHERE attempt_id = 1
  GROUP BY event_type, severity;
"
```

**Expected output:**
```
event_type              | severity  | count
-----------------------+-----------+-------
keyboard_blocked       | warning   | 1
developer_tools_attempt| violation | 1
```
