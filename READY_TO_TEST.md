## 🔧 Quick Timer Adjustment (Optional)

If you want to test faster without waiting 15 minutes:

### Option 1: Modify Pre-Exam Timer
```bash
# Edit the instructions component
docker-compose exec web sh -c "sed -i 's/15 \* 60/1 \* 60/' /app/src/pages/PreExamInstructions.tsx"

# Or manually change in file:
# /web/src/pages/PreExamInstructions.tsx
# Line ~50: const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(1 * 60); // 1 minute
```

### Option 2: Skip Timer Validation (Dev Mode)
```bash
# Edit the instructions component to disable timer check
# /web/src/pages/PreExamInstructions.tsx
# Line ~85: const isReady = true; // Force ready state
```
