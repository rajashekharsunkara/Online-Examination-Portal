# üîß FIXES APPLIED - ROUND 2

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')
**Problem:** `getCurrentQuestion()` was being called before exam data was loaded, causing `exam.questions[index]` to fail.

**Solution:** 
- Moved `currentQuestion = getCurrentQuestion()` declaration to AFTER all hooks
- Made proctoring hooks use `currentQuestionIndex` (number) instead of `currentQuestion?.id`
- Added safety check `!!exam && currentQuestionIndex >= 0` to questionTiming hook

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

### 2. ‚ùå Error: Failed to execute 'requestFullscreen' - API can only be initiated by user gesture
**Problem:** Tried to automatically enter full-screen mode on component mount, which browsers block for security.

**Solution:** 
- Removed automatic `fullScreen.enterFullScreen()` call on mount
- Full-screen should only be triggered by user click (from "Start Exam" button in instructions page)
- Kept notification permission request (allowed without user gesture)

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: 404 on `/api/v1/proctoring/events`
**Problem:** Proctoring hooks trying to POST events but getting 404.

**Possible Causes:**
1. API not fully started/registered
2. Proxy configuration issue
3. Authentication token issue

**Investigation Needed:**
```bash
# Test API endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/proctoring/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"attempt_id": 1, "event_type": "test", "severity": "info"}'
```

**Status:** ‚è≥ INVESTIGATING

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Error: answers is not iterable
**Problem:** `useOffline.ts:158` trying to iterate over answers but getting wrong data type.

**Likely Cause:** API returning answers in unexpected format.

**Status:** ‚è≥ INVESTIGATING

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket connection failed (1006)
**Problem:** WebSocket to `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/attempts/1` closing immediately.

**Possible Causes:**
1. API WebSocket endpoint not ready
2. Authentication issue
3. Network/proxy issue

**Status:** ‚è≥ KNOWN ISSUE (not blocking exam functionality, uses HTTP fallback)

---

## üìä Current System Status

```
‚úÖ Frontend: Running (with fixes applied)
‚úÖ Backend API: Healthy
‚úÖ Database: Connected
‚úÖ Redis: Healthy
‚ö†Ô∏è Proctoring Events API: 404 (investigating)
‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket: Connection failing (non-critical)
```

---

## üß™ Next Testing Steps

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check console** - should see fewer errors
3. **Try login again** - Hall Ticket: AP20250001
4. **Expected behavior:**
   - ‚úÖ No `currentQuestion` error
   - ‚úÖ No full-screen auto-trigger error
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è May still see 404 on proctoring events (investigating)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è May see WebSocket errors (non-critical)

## üîç Investigation Needed

### Test Proctoring API Endpoint
```bash
# 1. Get a valid token first (login as student)
# 2. Test proctoring endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/proctoring/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "attempt_id": 1,
    "event_type": "test_event",
    "severity": "info",
    "event_data": {}
  }'
```

### Check API Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs api --tail=50 | grep proctoring
```

### Verify Proctoring Router Registered
```bash
docker-compose exec api python -c "from app.main import app; print([r.path for r in app.routes if 'proctoring' in r.path])"
```
