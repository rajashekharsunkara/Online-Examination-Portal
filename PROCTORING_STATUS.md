# Proctoring System Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED (Backend Foundation)

### 1. Database Schema
**Tables Created:**
- ✅ `proctoring_events` - Logs all exam activities
  - Columns: id, attempt_id, event_type, event_timestamp, question_id, event_data (JSONB), user_agent, ip_address, severity, created_at
  - Indexes: attempt_id, event_type, severity, event_timestamp
  - Foreign keys: attempt_id → student_attempts(id), question_id → questions(id)
  
- ✅ `question_timings` - Tracks time spent on each question
  - Columns: id, attempt_id, question_id, first_viewed_at, last_viewed_at, total_time_seconds, answer_count, first_answered_at, last_answered_at
  - Unique constraint: (attempt_id, question_id)
  - Tracks answer change count and timing

**Event Types Supported:**
- `fullscreen_exit` - Student exited full-screen mode (severity: violation)
- `fullscreen_enter` - Student re-entered full-screen mode (severity: info)

- `ix_proctoring_events_event_type`
- `ix_proctoring_events_severity`
- `ix_proctoring_events_timestamp`
- `ix_question_timings_attempt_id`
