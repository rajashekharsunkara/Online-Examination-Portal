### Step 5: Check Backend Events
**Option 1: Via API (requires authentication)**
```bash
# Get violation summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/proctoring/attempt/{attemptId}/violations

# Get all events
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/proctoring/attempt/{attemptId}/events

# Get question timings
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/proctoring/attempt/{attemptId}/question-timings
```

**Option 2: Direct Database Query**
```bash
# Enter PostgreSQL container
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U exam_user -d exam_db

# Query proctoring events
SELECT 
  id, 
  event_type, 
  severity, 
  event_timestamp, 
  event_data 
FROM proctoring_events 
WHERE attempt_id = {attemptId}
ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;

# Query question timings
SELECT 
  question_id, 
  total_time_seconds, 
  answer_count,
  first_answered_at,
  last_answered_at
FROM question_timings 
WHERE attempt_id = {attemptId}
ORDER BY question_id;

# Count violations
SELECT 
  event_type, 
  severity, 
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM proctoring_events 
WHERE attempt_id = {attemptId}
GROUP BY event_type, severity
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected Event Types:**
```sql
fullscreen_enter       | info      | 1
fullscreen_exit        | violation | 3
tab_switch             | warning   | 5
window_blur            | warning   | 5
keyboard_blocked       | warning   | 10+
copy_paste_attempt     | violation | 3
developer_tools_attempt| violation | 2
answer_change          | info      | 15+
```

## ‚ö° QUICK TESTING (Modified Timers)

**For faster testing, modify timers:**

### Reduce Pre-Exam Timer
**File:** `/web/src/pages/PreExamInstructions.tsx`
```tsx
// Change line ~50
const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(15 * 60); // 15 minutes

// To:
const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(1 * 60); // 1 minute
```

### Reduce Exam Timer
**File:** Backend exam configuration or database
```sql
-- Update exam duration
UPDATE exams 
SET duration_minutes = 2 
WHERE id = {examId};
```

Or modify ExamTimer component:
**File:** `/web/src/components/ExamTimer.tsx`
```tsx
// Force 2-minute timer for testing
const initialTime = 2 * 60; // 2 minutes instead of exam.duration_minutes
```

**After modifications:**
```bash
# Rebuild frontend container
docker-compose restart web

# Wait for rebuild
docker-compose logs web --follow
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Full-screen not working
**Solution:**
- Ensure HTTPS (Fullscreen API requires secure context)
- Or test on localhost (exempt from HTTPS requirement)
- Update browser to latest version

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts still work
**Solution:**
- Some OS-level shortcuts (Windows key, Alt+Tab) cannot be fully prevented
- They are logged but cannot be blocked at browser level
- Check console for "keyboard_blocked" events

### Issue: Timer doesn't show warnings
**Solution:**
- Grant notification permissions when prompted
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify ExamTimer component is rendered

### Issue: Events not logging to backend
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check API logs
docker-compose logs api --follow

# Verify database connection
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U exam_user -d exam_db -c "\dt"

# Check proctoring tables exist
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U exam_user -d exam_db -c "\d proctoring_events"
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors in console
**Solution:**
- These are expected in development
- Code will compile correctly
- Ignore React type resolution warnings
