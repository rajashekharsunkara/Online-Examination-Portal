## 📊 QUESTION BANK STATUS

| Trade | Questions Available | Questions Per Exam | Status |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| ALL 48 TRADES | 0 | 25-30 | ⚠️ Upload questions from admin dashboard |

**Total Questions in Database:** 0 questions (ready for bulk upload)

## 🔄 HOW THE RANDOM SELECTION WORKS

When a student starts an exam:
1. System gets the student's trade (e.g., "Electrician")
2. Looks up trade settings (25 questions needed)
3. **Randomly selects 25 questions from the 50-question bank**
4. Each student gets a DIFFERENT random set
5. Selected questions are stored in `session_questions` table

**Example:**
- Student A (Electrician) might get questions: 3, 7, 12, 15, 19, 22, 25...
- Student B (Electrician) might get questions: 1, 5, 9, 13, 18, 21, 24...

---

## 🧪 TESTING WORKFLOW

### Test 1: Student Exam with Random Questions
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Login as **TEST2025001** (Electrician)
3. Start exam - you'll get 25 random questions from 50
4. Complete a few questions
5. Submit exam
6. Check results in Admin Portal

### Test 2: Different Random Questions
1. Login as **TEST2025002** (Fitter - different trade)
2. Start exam - you'll get 25 random Fitter questions
3. Notice different questions than Electrician
4. Different duration settings (same 90 min, but Computer Operator gets 120 min)

### Test 3: Admin Dashboard
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Login with admin/admin123
3. View "Results" tab - see completed exams
4. View "Proctoring" tab - see any violations
5. **NOTE:** "Exams" and "Questions" tabs need frontend update

---

## ⚠️ WHAT'S NOT YET UPDATED

The admin frontend (admin.js) still references the old "exams" concept. You'll see:
- ❌ "Exams" tab won't work properly
- ❌ "Questions" tab needs to be changed to "Question Bank"
- ❌ Upload questions feature needs trade_id instead of exam_id

**Next Steps:**
1. Update admin.html to change "Exams" to "Trades"
2. Update admin.js to manage question banks per trade
3. Update upload feature to work with new structure

---

## 📝 SAMPLE QUESTION JSON FORMAT (FOR BULK UPLOAD)

When the admin upload is fixed, use this format:

```json
{
  "trade_id": 1,
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_text": "What is the SI unit of electrical resistance?",
      "option_a": "Volt",
      "option_b": "Ampere",
      "option_c": "Ohm",
      "option_d": "Watt",
      "correct_answer": "C"
    },
    {
      "question_text": "Which device protects against earth leakage current?",
      "option_a": "MCB",
      "option_b": "ELCB",
      "option_c": "Fuse",
      "option_d": "Switch",
      "correct_answer": "B"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🎯 KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OLD SYSTEM

### Old System (Before):
- Separate "exams" table
- Admin created exams manually
- Questions linked to specific exam_id
- Fixed question set for all students

### New System (Now):
- **No exams table** - Trade IS the exam
- Admin just uploads questions to question bank
- Questions linked to trade_id
- **Random selection** - each student gets different questions
- Admin sets: duration, question count, marks per question (per trade)
