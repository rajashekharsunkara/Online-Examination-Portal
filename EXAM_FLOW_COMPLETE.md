# ✅ Complete Exam Flow - READY

## All Fixes Applied (Round 8)

### 1. ✅ Pre-Exam Instructions (15-Minute Wait)
**What was missing**: Students were going directly to exam without instructions
**What we fixed**:
- Login now redirects to `/exam/{attemptId}/instructions` instead of `/exam/{attemptId}`
- Students must:
  1. **Wait 15 minutes** (countdown timer displayed)
  2. **Confirm their details** (hall ticket, name, center, district, trade)
  3. **Read and accept all rules** (comprehensive proctoring rules, prohibited activities, etc.)
  4. Only then can click "Start Exam"
- Clicking "Start Exam" automatically enters **full-screen mode**
- Then navigates to the actual exam page

### 2. ✅ Automatic Full-Screen Entry
**What was missing**: Full-screen wasn't starting automatically
**What we fixed**:
- PreExamInstructions component calls `document.documentElement.requestFullscreen()` when "Start Exam" is clicked
- This ensures the exam starts in full-screen mode immediately
- If user denies full-screen permission, they get an alert and cannot proceed

### 3. ✅ Violation Count Display Fix
**What was wrong**: Alert showed "(0/3)" even after first violation
**What we fixed**:
- Fixed race condition in `useFullScreen.ts`
- Now correctly calculates `newExitCount` BEFORE showing alert
- Alert now shows "(1/3)" for first violation, "(2/3)" for second, etc.
- Changed message to: "⚠️ WARNING: You have exited full-screen mode! Return to full-screen immediately. Violation logged (1/3)"

### 4. ✅ CORS Error on Submit
**What was wrong**: Submit API call going to `http://localhost:8000` instead of through Vite proxy
**What we fixed**:
- Changed `API_BASE_URL` from `'http://localhost:8000'` to `''` (empty string)
- Now all API calls go through Vite proxy at `/api` which forwards to backend
- This fixes CORS errors on submit and all other API calls

### 5. ✅ Question Options Format
**What was wrong**: Backend sends `{"A": "text", "B": "text"}`, frontend expects `["text", "text"]`
**What we fixed**:
- Transform options object to array when exam loads
- Sort by key (A, B, C, D) to maintain correct order
- Added defensive code in MCQQuestion to handle both formats

### 6. ✅ Attempt Auto-Start
**What was wrong**: Attempts stayed in `NOT_STARTED`, preventing submission
**What we fixed**:
- Added backend endpoint `/api/v1/attempts/{id}/begin`
- Frontend automatically calls it when exam loads
- Transitions attempt from `NOT_STARTED` → `IN_PROGRESS`
