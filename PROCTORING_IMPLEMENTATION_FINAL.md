## 📈 ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES

### For Admins

**Violation Summary (GET `/api/v1/proctoring/attempt/{id}/violations`)**
```json
{
  "total_violations": 12,
  "violation_count": 5,
  "warning_count": 7,
  "info_count": 50,
  "event_type_counts": {
    "fullscreen_exit": 3,
    "tab_switch": 4,
    "copy_paste_attempt": 2
  },
  "most_recent_violation_time": "2025-01-12T10:45:30Z",
  "most_recent_violation_type": "fullscreen_exit"
}
```

**Question Timing Analysis**
- Average time per question
- Questions answered too fast (< 10s)
- Questions with many answer changes
- Time distribution across exam

**Suspicious Patterns**
- Multiple full-screen exits
- Extended tab switches during difficult questions
- Copy/paste attempts
- Developer tools access attempts

## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues

**Full-screen won't activate:**
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for Fullscreen API)
- Update browser to latest version
- Check browser settings/permissions

**Timer not visible:**
- Clear browser cache
- Check z-index conflicts in CSS
- Verify ExamTimer component renders

**Events not logging:**
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Check authentication token validity
- Review browser console for errors

**Keyboard blocking not working:**
- Some shortcuts (Windows key, Alt+Tab) cannot be fully prevented
- They are logged but OS-level shortcuts bypass browser
